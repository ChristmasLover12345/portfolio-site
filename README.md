This is supposed to be the first rendition of my portfolio site, containing all of the relevant projects i did during my time at codestack academy

things that should be in here:

RIDE, a social media app focused on people who wanna share their experiences riding motocycles

my top 5 jobs website

my pokemon API website in next.js (maybe)
