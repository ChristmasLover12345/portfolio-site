Review: I like animations and the aesthetic of the app, I used Framer Motion too and it makes the site more attention-grabbing. I would correct "Portfolio on the website name in the tab and either capitalize "My" in "my name is Juan" or lowecase the whole sentence. The Links to socials and resume sticking to the edge of the screen is a good call but I think the email should have more of a presence within the page, great job!
